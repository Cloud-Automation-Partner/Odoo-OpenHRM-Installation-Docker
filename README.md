# Odoo Docker OpenHRM Integration

Welcome to the Odoo Docker OpenHRM Integration repository. This comprehensive guide is designed to facilitate the setup of Odoo with Docker, incorporating the powerful features of OpenHRM. Follow the structured steps below for a seamless integration and deployment process.

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local environment to access the necessary Docker configurations and scripts.

**Command:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cloud-Automation-Partner/Odoo-OpenHRM-Installation-Docker.git
```
## Building the Odoo Docker Image

Using the Dockerfile provided within this repository, build the custom Odoo Docker image that is tailored for this setup and as of I am using the Odoo 16 to setup so switch the directory first.

**Instructions:**
Navigate to the folder containing the Dockerfile and run:

```bash
cd Odoo-docker/16.0
docker build -t Odoo-OpenHRM:latest .
docker images #Verify the image creation
```
## Integrating OpenHRM  

For effective integration of OpenHRM, manually copy the OpenHRM source code into the designated Docker volume as specified in your Docker Compose configuration.

Run below commands:

```bash
mkdir addons
cp -r OpenHRMS ./addons
mkdir config
cp Odoo-docker/16.0/odoo.conf ./config
```

## Configuring Docker Compose with Postgres

Customize your Docker Compose setup by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file orchestrates the configuration of your Odoo and PostgreSQL services.

- Ensure the PostgreSQL service is correctly configured with the necessary environment variables.
- Adjust the Odoo service settings for optimal performance and compatibility with OpenHRM.

```yml
version: '3.1'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
    volumes:
      - odoo-web-data:/var/lib/odoo
      - ./config:/etc/odoo
      - ./addons:/mnt/extra-addons
    environment:
      - HOST=db
      - USER=odoo
      - PASSWORD=myodoo
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myodoo
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    volumes:
      - odoo-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
volumes:
  odoo-web-data:
  odoo-db-data:
```

## Spinning Up the Containers

Launch the Docker containers using Docker Compose. This command will initiate and run both the PostgreSQL database and the Odoo application.

**Command:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Accessing Odoo

Once the Docker containers are operational, access the Odoo application using the following URL:

- **URL:** [http://localhost:8069](http://localhost:8069)


## Additional Notes

This setup allows for customization and extension:

- Modify the environment variables and other configurations in the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your project's specific requirements.
- Explore additional Docker and Odoo configurations to further tailor this setup.

We wish you a successful implementation and a productive experience with your Odoo and OpenHRM integrated environment.

Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
